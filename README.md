## Course Description 

For any employee looking to learn their first data science skill, this is the perfect opportunity to jumpstart their data science journey. 
Over three hours, students learn how to discover customer segments in customer behavior data, which will allow them to craft better marketing and product strategies for increased revenue.

Students will first start with an overview of key data science terminology. 
After understanding the data science landscape, students will go deep into one facet of data science: clustering in machine learning. 
Students will work along with the instructor to discover customer segments within a customer information dataset.

This course will cover:

* [ ] Basic theory behind unsupervised machine learning
* [ ] How to use foundational algorithms in Python
* [ ] Basics of Python for clustering via an applied example 
* [ ] Common pitfalls when carrying out clustering analyses

## Learning Objectives 

After taking this course, you will be able to: 

* [ ] Explain the differences between regression and classification tasks in machine learning
* [ ] Explain the differences between supervised and unsupervised machine learning
* [ ] Given an example of regression problem in machine learning
* [ ] Given an example of classification problem in machine learning
* [ ] Given an example of clustering problem in machine learning

* [ ] Identify the two most common types of clustering algorithms used in data science
* [ ] Explain how the idea of similarity is at the core of all clustering algorithms 
* [ ] Summerise what the goals of running a k-means clustering analysis are 
* [ ] Summerise what the goals of running a hierarchical agglomorative clustering analysis are 
* [ ] Interpret the output of denrogram  

* [ ] Identify what data is required to run a clustering analysis
* [ ] Identify what Python libraries are needed to run a clustering analysis
* [ ] Identify what different arguments in ski-kit learn can be used to run analysis?

* [ ] Explain why the results of a k-means clustering algorithm can be interpreted as being "True"
* [ ] Explain why it is bad practice to interpret vertical similarities in a dendrogram
