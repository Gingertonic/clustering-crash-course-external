## Course Description 

For any employee looking to learn their first data science skill, this is the perfect opportunity to jumpstart their data science journey. 
Over three hours, students learn how to discover customer segments in customer behavior data, which will allow them to craft better marketing and product strategies for increased revenue.

Students will first start with an overview of key data science terminology. 
After understanding the data science landscape, students will go deep into one facet of data science: clustering in machine learning. 
Students will work along with the instructor to discover customer segments within a customer information dataset.

This course will cover:

* [ ] Basic theory behind unsupervised machine learning
* [ ] Basics of Python
* [ ] How to use foundational algorithms in Python
* [ ] Common pitfalls when carrying out clustering analyses

## Learning Objectives 

After taking this course, you will be able to: 

* [ ] Explain the difference between supervised and unsupervised machine learning
* [ ] Identify business cases when you would want to use unsupervised machine learning 
* [ ] Explain why the idea of similarity is at the core of clustering analyses
* [ ] Summerise what the goals of running a k-means clustering analysis are 
* [ ] Summerise what the goals of running a hierarchical agglomorative clustering analysis are 
* [ ] Interpret the output of denrogram  
* [ ] Explain how the k-means algorithm works  
* [ ] Identify what data is required to run a clustering analysis
* [ ] Identify what Python libraries are needed to run a clustering analysis
* [ ] Identify what different arguments in ski-kit learn can be used to run analysis?
* [ ] Explain what can go wrong when using unsupervised machine learning

## Attendee Persona (delete eventually) 

The three hour course is designed for individuals with little to no experience in data science looking to learn the basic concepts behind an unsupervised machine learning technique called clustering.
We assume that participants work in a business or not-for-profit setting and are able to talk about what value they bring to their respective organizations. 
We do not assume that the majority of participants code regularly as a part of their work, but are very interested in eventually acquiring that skill set. 
Participants of this crash course want to acquire foundational knowledge about unsupervised machine learning, specifically the pros and cons of clustering analysis.
